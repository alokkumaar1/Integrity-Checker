# Integrity-Checker
An **Integrity Checker** verifies data, files, or software for accuracy and tampering using cryptographic hashes (e.g., SHA-256). It detects unauthorized changes, ensures compliance, and enhances security by monitoring file integrity. Commonly used in cybersecurity and forensics, it helps prevent data corruption and unauthorized modifications.
